# Tidying


Analysis shows that you can categorize the data into 4 segments 
* training set 
* test set 
* features 
* activity labels

Inertial Signal data is not required. Additionally, features and activity label are more for tagging and descriptive than data sets.


The assignment objectives are completed in 3 parts:
1.  Downloads the dataset then unzips it to the chosen local folder
2.  Reads the text files and stores data in data frames. Also merges the tables (First Objective)
3.  Tidies the data and answers Objectives 2-5
